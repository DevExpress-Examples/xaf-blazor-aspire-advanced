# XAF Blazor â€” .NET Aspire Support â€” Custom Telemetry, Service Orchestration, Database Dependency

This example leverages the following .NET Aspire capabilities within an XAF-powered Blazor application:

* **Custom Telemetry with OpenTelemetry**. Log custom activities/metrics with OpenTelemetry, which are then visualized in the Aspire Dashboard. This integration allows you to monitor and analyze application performance and behavior.
* **Database Dependency Management**. Run SQL Server as a dependency inside a container coordinated by Aspire. This approach simplifies database management and deployment.
* **Service Orchestration**. Configure your Blazor application as part of Aspire orchestration. This configuration allows you to manage and coordinate multiple services in your application ecosystem.

As you would expect, these features improve observability, modularity, and deployment flexibility within your XAF-powered Blazor application if using .NET Aspire.
